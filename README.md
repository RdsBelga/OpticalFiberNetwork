# Optical Fiber Network Reorganization

## Description
This project involves the reorganization of an urban optical fiber network to enhance the efficiency and distribution of fiber optic cables among multiple operators. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Network Reconstruction:** Initially, the project aims to develop a complete plan of the current network. This involves collecting data from different operators who own sections of the network to create a comprehensive map, ensuring that every cable and fiber used is accounted for.

2. **Network Reorganization:** The second phase focuses on optimizing the allocation of fibers across the network. It addresses issues such as the underutilization of certain cables and the excessive length of others, proposing solutions to redistribute fibers more efficiently among the operators.

This project is designed to apply and test various algorithms for optimal network configuration, using real-world data sets and scenarios to measure effectiveness.
